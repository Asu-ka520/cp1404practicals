## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
My initial time estimates were often inaccurate, and I tended to underestimate how long tasks would actually take.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My initial time estimates were often inaccurate, and I tended to underestimate how long tasks would actually take.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As I became more familiar with the content and the workflow, my estimates gradually became more realistic and reliable.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to reflect on how I plan my study sessions, and realized that breaking tasks down into smaller steps helps with more accurate estimating.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Feedback from others helped me see my own areas for improvement and gave me new perspectives on how to write better quality code.
### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

By reviewing other people's code and offering suggestions, I discovered different implementation ideas and practiced identifying issues and communicating feedback clearly.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

Car.py

### Explanation

I not only pointed out inconsistent variable naming but also suggested clearer comments and encouraged the addition of test cases, giving constructive feedback for improvement.

### Good Code Review 2

Trees.py

### Explanation

I carefully read the implementation, gave specific suggestions on readability and code structure, and acknowledged the author's progress with respectful and positive communication.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add more real-world examples so everyone can better understand the practical application of the code and include more frequent small quizzes for quick feedback.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I stayed patient and attentive, actively sought information and help when I encountered problems, and consistently practiced and reflected on my coding style.
