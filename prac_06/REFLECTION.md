# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I now value code readability. In the past, I only cared about whether the code could run.
Now I think: "Can others understand this code?" I try to use meaningful variable names and add appropriate comments.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

The biggest problem is procrastination... I often wait until the last few days to start doing homework, and the result is always rushed and the code quality is not good.
I need to change this habit and start doing homework early to give myself enough time to test and improve the code

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Check more times after commit

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Procrastination

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I hope the course can add more exercises on real projects instead of just small exercises
