# Practical 07

Author: [HU ZEDONG]
Throughout this subject, I have learned several important lessons about writing clean code, including:

Write clear, descriptive variable and function names so that code is easy to read and maintain.
Keep functions short and single-purpose to improve readability and reduce bugs.
Consistently use code formatting (indentation, spacing, etc.) and follow naming conventions for a professional codebase.
